<h1 align="center">Lesson 2: Styling, Props and State</h1>

In this lesson you'll be introduced to a styling pre-processor(Saas) and a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS). You'll also be introduced to the useState hook and how to use it to manage state in your React application and learn how to manipulate data from a JSON object using the higher order array methods such as map, filter, and reduce.

## 1. Using a pre-processer for styling (Saas)
You'll only be familiarized with the basics of Saas in this lesson assuming you are from a background of CSS. You'll be introduced to the concept of variables and nesting.
