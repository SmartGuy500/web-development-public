## Challenge:
*** Array Manipulation with Functional Programming ***

Write a function manipulateArray(arr) that takes an array of integers arr as an input and performs the following operations on it using functional programming concepts:

- Use map to double every value in the array.
- Use filter to keep only values that are greater than 10.
- Use reduce to find the sum of the remaining values

The function should return the final sum.
