<h1 align="center">Lesson 4: Fetching Libraries </h1>

In this lesson we will learn about fetching libraries. We will be using the Axios library to fetch data from an API. We will also be using the React Router to create a single page application that will allow us to navigate between different pages.

## Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node's http interface. It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React. It is also used as the HTTP client for the popular AngularJS framework.
