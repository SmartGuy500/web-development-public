# Project Name: Recipe Book App

## Project Description:

Create a web application that allows users to view and save recipes. Users should be able to browse through different recipes, search for specific recipes, and save their favorite recipes to a personal recipe book.

## Project Requirements:

Home Page - The home page should have a search bar where users can search for recipes. The page should also display a list of popular recipes.

Recipe Page - The recipe page should display the recipe's title, image, ingredients, and instructions. It should also have a button to save the recipe to the user's personal recipe book.

Personal Recipe Book - The personal recipe book should display all the recipes that the user has saved. The user should be able to view, edit, and delete their saved recipes.

Testing with Jest - Use Jest to write unit tests for your JavaScript code.

Responsive Design - The application should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Styling - Use CSS to style the application and make it visually appealing.

Accessibility - Ensure that the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Bonus Features:

User Authentication - Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up and log in to their personal recipe book.

Recipe Sharing - Allow users to share recipes on social media platforms.

Recipe Categories - Categorize recipes by type of cuisine or meal.

Recipe Rating - Allow users to rate recipes and display the average rating for each recipe.

Shopping List - Allow users to create a shopping list for the ingredients they need to buy for their saved recipes.

By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional web application that demonstrates your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jest testing.
