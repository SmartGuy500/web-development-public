1. As a user, I want to be able to view a collection of photos on the homepage so that I can browse through them.

2. As a user, I want to be able to view the details of a photo by clicking on it, including its title, description, and tags.

3. As a user, I want to be able to filter the photos on the homepage by tags so that I can find photos that are relevant to my interests.

4. As a user, I want to be able to view the photos on the homepage on both desktop and mobile devices so that I can browse them on the go.

7. As a user, I want to be able to like or deslike interesting photos.

## Technical Requirements

To complete this project, you will need to use the following technologies and tools:

1. Python 3.x
2. Django 3.x
3. HTML5
4. CSS3
5. Bootstrap 4.x

You will need to create a new Django project and a new Django app to build the website. The website should include multiple HTML templates, one for each page of the website. You should use Django's template inheritance feature to create a base template that can be used as the layout for all other templates.

-  You will need to use models and databases for this project. 
-  The website should be visually appealing and polished, with an attractive color scheme and design elements.
-  The code should be consistently indented and formatted for easy readability.
-  The code should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section of code.
- The project should use Git for version control, with regular commits, at least 30, and appropriate commit messages.
- The project should be deployed to a live website or hosting platform e.g render, and the link to the live site should be provided in the README.md file.
