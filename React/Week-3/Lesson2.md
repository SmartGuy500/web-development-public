<h1>Lesson 2: useReducer Hook & Redux Toolkit intro </h1>

In this lesson we will learn about the useReducer hook and how it can be used to manage state in React applications. We will also be introduced to the Redux Toolkit and how it can be used to manage state in React applications.

## useReducer Hook
The useReducer hook is an alternative to the useState hook. It is usually preferable to use useReducer when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
