<h1 align="center">Lesson 3: API Fetching With Redux & CRUD operation</h1>

In this lesson we will learn about Redux, a state management library for JavaScript applications. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

## CRUD Operations
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. We will be using the Django Rest Framework to create a REST API that will allow us to perform CRUD operations on our data. We will also be using the React Router to create a single page application that will allow us to navigate between different pages.
