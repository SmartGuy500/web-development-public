### Integrated development environment
You will need a text editor to use to write programs. In particular, there are number of editors you should not use for programming including, Microsoft Word, NotePad, TextEdit or Libre Office. These editors tend not to store "plain text" which is how we need to write programs. Programs cannot have things like bold, italics, or different fonts - and even if you don't use these things in your file, the files are stored in a format that can represent all this "pretty" text stuff - and that confuses compilers and interpreters.

If you already have an editor or development environment installed please keep using it. There is no need to install another editor just for this course.

### Recommended Programmer Editor

### Getting started with Git
Watch Video, Kevin Stratvert

In this step-by-step tutorial, learn how to use Git and GitHub for source control management (SCM). We start with Git. What is it? How you can get it running on your system, and how you can start working with it? Then we look at GitHub.com, a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. By the end of this video, you'll be well on your way to using Git and GitHub. If you'd like to follow along, I've included sample files down below.
