<h1>Lesson 2: NextJS Features</h1>

In this lesson we will learn about the features of NextJS. We will learn about the different features of NextJS and how they can be used to build server-side rendered React applications.

## Routing

Routing is the process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on). Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

## Static Site Generation

Static Generation is the process of pre-rendering pages at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.

## Incremental Static Generation

Incremental Static Generation is a feature that allows you to update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in. This means that you can update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in. This means that you can update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in.

## Dynamic Routing

Dynamic Routing is the process of using parameters in a page's file name to create a single page that is used for multiple routes.
