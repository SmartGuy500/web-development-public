<h1 align="center">Week 3 Lesson 1: Intro To State Management</h1>
State management in React is a very important concept to understand. In this lesson we will be learning about the basics of state management in React. We will be using the Context API to manage state in our React applications.

## Context API
The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
