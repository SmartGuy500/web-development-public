# Coding Challenge
Create a simple web page with two buttons, each with a different background color. When a button is clicked, the background color of the page should change to the color of the clicked button. Additionally, if the user clicks anywhere on the page outside of the buttons, the background color should return to its original color.

### Requirements:

- Use event listeners to detect when a button is clicked and when the page is clicked outside of the buttons.
- Use event propagation to ensure that clicking on a button doesn't trigger the click event for the page.
- Use CSS to style the buttons and the page.

### Bonus:

- Add more buttons with different colors and modify the code to handle these new buttons dynamically.
- Add an undo button that allows the user to revert the background color to the previous state.

Good luck!
